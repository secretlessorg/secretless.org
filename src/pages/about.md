# About Secretless.cloud

## Our Mission

Secretless.cloud exists to **educate and promote the use of secretless authentication workflows among cloud professionals**. We believe that long-lived credentials and static secrets represent one of the most significant security risks in modern cloud infrastructure, and that the industry can do better.

## Why Secretless Authentication?

Traditional authentication methods rely on long-lived tokens, API keys, and credentials that:
- Create significant security risks when compromised
- Require complex rotation and lifecycle management
- Increase the attack surface for credential theft
- Complicate compliance and audit requirements

Secretless authentication using OIDC (OpenID Connect) and just-in-time tokens eliminates these risks by:
- Providing short-lived, automatically rotating credentials
- Leveraging existing identity providers for authentication
- Reducing the need to store and manage secrets
- Enabling fine-grained, claim-based authorization

## What We Provide

This site offers comprehensive documentation for implementing secretless workflows across:
- **Major cloud providers**: AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Azure, Kubernetes, Cloudflare
- **CI/CD platforms**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, and more
- **Infrastructure tools**: Terraform Cloud, Pulumi, and other IaC platforms

Our guides provide step-by-step instructions, best practices, and real-world examples to help teams transition from traditional secret-based authentication to modern secretless workflows.
