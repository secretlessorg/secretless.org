# New Relic Secretless Authentication

New Relic supports OIDC-based authentication for agents and API access without storing license keys.

## Overview

New Relic's OIDC support enables monitoring infrastructure without embedding license keys or API keys. This provides:

- **No License Keys**: OIDC tokens replace New Relic license keys
- **Agent Authentication**: Secretless agent deployment
- **API Integration**: OIDC-based API access
- **Enhanced Security**: No credential storage in configuration

## Key Capabilities

- OIDC authentication for New Relic agents
- API access with OIDC tokens
- Integration with cloud provider identities
- Account and sub-account controls
